# HealthyDiscord
Set limits on how many servers you can join and how many msgs you can send per day

## Why the heck would i wanna do this?
Because discord can make some people go CrAzY, and it negatively impacts their mental state. Trust me, i know too many people that appear to go thru this without realising it. Are they going to use this? Probably not, unless they're one of the few that can admit to themselves that they have a problem.

Although Discord is extremely useful, it's totally addicting. Undoubtedly.

# Setup
To set this boi up you need a vps or a computer that can stay on 24/7, simply download a JAR file from the releases tab, and `cd` to the directory it's in, and do `java -jar discordlimits.jar`. next it'll generate a config that you'll have to edit and add your discord token, and set the limits you want to limit yoruseelf to. Then, you can start it up again and keep it running for as long as you use discord, or well until you hit your daily limit and persuade yourself to Ctrl-C so you can send more messages. :pensive:

tbh @PhiPhi1 u should use this like lowkey
